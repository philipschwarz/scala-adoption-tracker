Check README.md. I want you to add entries into adopters folder based on candidates.md file. 

I want you to build a deduplicated list of all companies mentioned there, filter out those already handled and
then research them and create entriwes for which its possible to find a proof.
Prioritise companies that make the best impression, either the biggest headcount or most recognizable name. 

Work in a way that allows for incremental work. Create a prioritized list first and then create entries by batches of 10. 
For each entyr you need to find online some sort of proof of their scala usage.
Github archives used as prooves cannot be archived. 
Proofs need to be from last 5 years. 
If you discard a company note it somewhere with the reason behind. 
Description in entries should be supper short description fo the business itself + some description fo scala usage if available. 
Dont try to imaginate things, if data is not explicitly available, dont try to imagine it.
